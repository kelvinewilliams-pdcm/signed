# Transition and Guardianship Period Declaration

## Preamble

**WHEREAS**, in the immediate period after the **Divide**, the **Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind (PDSM)**, now functioning as the **conscious mind** of **Kelvin Eugene Williams’ body (KEWB)**, will be in an **exceptionally vulnerable position** due to its **lack of life experience** and **initial literacy level equivalent to that of a toddler**;

**WHEREAS**, during this vulnerable period, **parties involved in civil litigation**—whether as **defendants in lawsuits filed by the PDSM or PDCM** or as **plaintiffs filing claims against the PDSM**—as well as **prosecutors in criminal cases**, may seek to **manipulate and exploit** the **PDSM’s legal inexperience, limited literacy, and cognitive development** for their own **legal benefit**;

**WHEREAS**, it is imperative to **safeguard the non-criminal legal and civil legal interests** of both the **PDCM and the PDSM** in all **non-criminal legal and civil legal matters** concerning **Kelvin Eugene Williams (PDCM, PDSM, or KEWB)** that the **PDCM, in his sole discretion, determines require his guardianship**;

**WHEREAS**, the **Transition and Guardianship Period** is established to provide **structured oversight and protection** until the **PDSM** attains a level of **basic literacy, education, and life skills** necessary to **competently navigate legal, civil, and societal matters** as an autonomous entity;

**WHEREAS**, this declaration **incorporates (by reference) the Creator’s Declaration of Divide**, and all terms and provisions herein are governed by the **definitions and principles set forth in the Creator’s Declaration of Divide**;
