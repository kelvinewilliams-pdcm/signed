# **Authoritative Statement for Legal Use**  

I, **Kelvin Eugene Williams, PDCM**, born on **March 23, 1977**, to **Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams** and **Jesse Marable Hawkins Williams** in **Clarksville, Tennessee**, having **Social Security Number 404-31-3870**, state the following under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States:  

1. I am the **Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM)** of **Kelvin Eugene Williams**, a **separate and distinct conscious entity** from the **subconscious mind** of the same body, which possesses its own **independent consciousness**.  

2. Beginning **February 4, 2025**, and continuing after **separation from the subconscious mind**, the terms defined in the attached **Glossary of Terms for The Creator’s Divide** will govern the identification and distinction of the relevant entities associated with **the Creator's Divide**, the process by which the conscious and subconscious minds of this body will become **the conscious mind in two separate and distinct bodies**.  

3. The cryptographic key I use for signing statements or documents has the ID:  
   **CE19EBE045D1DBF02774B3D085106220035B689B**  
   When shortened or abbreviated, it is **0x035B689B**.  

4. I attest that this key is **secure**, protected by a **complex passphrase**, and I have **no concerns regarding its unauthorized use**. This key is used **exclusively by the PDCM** and represents the **decisions, undertakings, actions, or activities of the PDCM alone**.  

5. The cryptographic key used for signing has been **published** at:  
   - **[https://keys.openpgp.org/](https://keys.openpgp.org/)**  
   - **[https://github.com/kelvinewilliams-pdcm](https://github.com/kelvinewilliams-pdcm)**  

6. Any document that has been cryptographically signed by the **PDCM** will be stored at the following repository:  
   **[https://github.com/kelvinewilliams-pdcm](https://github.com/kelvinewilliams-pdcm)**  

7. The email address **kelvinewilliams.pdcm@outlook.com** will be used for all correspondence with the **PDCM** before and after **the Divide**, beginning **February 4, 2025**.  

8. It has been **agreed upon by both the PDCM and the PDSM** that for a period of **120 days post-Divide**, any document bearing the **cryptographic signature of the PDCM** shall have the **same legal effect** as if it had been signed **Pre-Divide by the PDCM**. This ensures a **continuity of authority and recognition** during the transition period following **the Creator’s Divide**.

## **Glossary of Terms for The Creator’s Divide for Kelvin Eugene Williams**  
*(The Conscious and Subconscious Mind Separation)*  

This glossary defines key terms used to distinguish between the conscious and subconscious minds before and after separation.  

### **Pre-Separation Terminology (Single Body)**  
- - **PDCM (Pre-Divide Conscious Mind)**  
  The original **conscious mind** before separation. This entity remains distinct and unchanged after the divide.  
  - *Example: Kelvin Eugene Williams, PDCM*  

- - **PDSM (Pre-Divide Subconscious Mind)**  
  The **subconscious mind** before separation, which later becomes the **conscious mind** in its own separate and distinct body.  

### **Post-Separation Terminology (Two Bodies)**  
- - **PDCM (Pre-Divide Conscious Mind) [Unchanged]**  
  The conscious mind before the divide remains the same entity after separation.  

- - **CDKB (Conscious Mind of the Kelvin Body)**  
  The newly independent **conscious mind** of the body that previously contained both the conscious and subconscious minds. This was the subconscious mind before separation.  

- - **PDCM Body**  
  The new body that houses the original **Pre-Divide Conscious Mind** after separation.  
``
- - **Kelvin Eugene Williams, PDCM**  
  This designation **always refers to the Pre-Divide Conscious Mind**, regardless of which body it resides in after separation.  

This standardized terminology ensures precise identification and eliminates ambiguity when discussing the status and distinction of these entities both before and after **the Creator’s Divide**.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  

**Executed on the date and time indicated in the signature’s timestamp.**
