**WHEREAS**, any **real property, personal property, intellectual property, financial assets, legal claims, or other rights** that **Kelvin Eugene Williams (KEWB)** is entitled to inherit, whether by **last will and testament, intestate succession, probate law, contract, or any other legal mechanism**, are inherently tied to the **PDCM** as the entity that was **historically recognized** as the heir;

**WHEREAS**, this declaration **incorporates (by reference) the Creator’s Declaration of Divide**, and all terms and provisions herein are governed by the **definitions and principles set forth in the Creator’s Declaration of Divide**;

### 1. Inheritance Rights Assignment
- - The **Pre-Divide Conscious Mind (PDCM)** shall **retain all inheritance rights** to **any and all real property, personal property, financial assets, intellectual property, legal claims, or any other inheritances or rights** that **Kelvin Eugene Williams (KEWB) is or may be entitled to receive**.

### 2. Exclusive Rights of the PDCM
- - The **PDCM** shall be the **sole legal heir and inheritor** of all property, assets, and rights designated for **Kelvin Eugene Williams (KEWB)** until the **death of the PDCM**.
- - No **probate court, estate administrator, trustee, or any legal entity** shall have the authority to transfer inherited assets or rights to any **entity or consciousness** other than the **PDCM**, except in the case of **a valid legal claim by a third party**.
